# **Test performance of different types of 3D arrays**

The application tests the performance of various types of 3D (three-dimensional) arrays. Test results are output to the console.

## Tested types of arrays:

- Simple 3D array (`[][][] of float`).
- Simple pseudo 3D array (`[] of float`).
- Typed pseuado 3D array (`new Float32Array()`).
- 3D Map (`new Map()`).

## Tested parameters:

- Time taken to creating arrays.
- Time taken to sequential writing arrays.
- Time taken to random writing arrays.
- Time taken to sequential reading arrays.
- Time taken to random reading arrays.

Test results are collected in a summary table in console.
